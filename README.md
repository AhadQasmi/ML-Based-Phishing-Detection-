# ML-Based-Phishing-Detection-
Phishing has become a significant security risk in recent years, impacting both the targeted companies and people. phishing URLs are URLs that are specially created by phishing attackers The common characteristic of these URLs is that they appear to be a legitimate URL but redirect users to the attackersâ€™ websites to steal information from users.
 
The "PhishEagle" system was designed to combat phishing attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information. The system leverages a Random Forest model trained on a large Mendeley dataset from 2020, which provides a significant advantage in identifying the most recent phishing attempts.

The system achieved a notable accuracy rate of 99.40% in classifying URLs as either phishing or legitimate, reflecting its high precision and effectiveness. To enhance user accessibility, the PhishEagle system was integrated as a user-friendly browser extension, allowing users to input URLs for classification directly. When a URL is entered, the system processes it and displays the result to the user.

This project represents an important step towards improving cybersecurity and helping users avoid online phishing risks
