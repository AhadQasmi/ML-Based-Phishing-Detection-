# PhishEagle - Machine Learning-Based Phishing Detection System
## Overview
Phishing has emerged as a significant cybersecurity threat, affecting both individuals and organizations. Phishing URLs are deceptively crafted to appear legitimate, but they redirect users to malicious sites aimed at stealing sensitive information.

The **PhishEagle** system was developed to combat these phishing attacks by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Utilizing a **Random Forest** model trained on a comprehensive Mendeley dataset from 2020, PhishEagle excels in identifying recent phishing attempts with remarkable accuracy.

### Key Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive classification accuracy of **99.40%**, effectively distinguishing between phishing and legitimate URLs.
- **User-Friendly Browser Extension**: Integrated as a browser extension, allowing users to easily input URLs for immediate classification.

This project is a vital step toward enhancing online security and empowering users to avoid phishing risks.
